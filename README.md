## Problem Statement

Design a technology-based solution that aims to tackle an issue related to one of the climate change subtopics presented earlier: 

1. sustainability
2. saving the ocean
3. disaster management

### Chosen Case Problem: Phosphate and Nitrate levels in soils, contaminating nearby crops and water sources

<p>Phosphate is a naturally occurring mineral that is essential for plant growth, but too much of it can have negative impacts on both soil and water quality. When farmers apply excessive amounts of phosphate-based fertilizers, the excess phosphate can accumulate in the soil, leading to soil degradation and decreased crop yields over time.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when phosphate from fertilizers is washed away by rainfall or irrigation, it can enter nearby water bodies, causing an overgrowth of algae and other aquatic plants. This process, known as eutrophication, depletes oxygen levels in the water, leading to the death of fish and other aquatic animals. Eutrophication can also cause the release of toxic chemicals that can harm human health, making it a significant environmental concern. Therefore, it is important for farmers to use phosphate-based fertilizers judiciously to maintain healthy soil and water ecosystems.</p>

<p>In 1986, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the following recommended criteria for phosphorus: No more than 0.1 mg/L for streams that do not empty into reservoirs; no more than 0.05 mg/L for streams discharging into reservoirs; and no more than 0.024 mg/L for reservoirs.</p>

## Proposed Solution



## Run Instructions

To run on local server: 

1. cd into working directory pest-control

2. run, *bash run.sh*

3. redirect to local host: 
  - <http://127.0.0.1:8000>

To run on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) App Engine:

1. Deploy by running GCP SDK in the project directory

2. open the application website with this url: 
  - <https://pest-control-382419.uk.r.appspot.com/>
